# Will's Blueprints Folder

This folder is reserved for Will's custom blueprints for the side-scrolling character variant.

You can store:
- Custom Blueprint classes based on the C++ character selection system
- UI Blueprints for the character selection menu
- Character-specific blueprints for the side-scrolling variant
- Any other custom blueprints for the project

This .gitkeep file ensures the folder is tracked by Git even when empty.
